- able to control seven servo motors based on the command from the webpage

## 03-23-2018

## Updates
- realtime PWM and UART implementations enabled by timer triggered interrupt component.
- able to read data from function generator and display the signal in the LabVIEW virtual instrument.

## 04-10-2018

## Updates
- realtime servo control (realized by implementing timer triggered interrupt)
- smoothen the servo movement by segmenting the angle commands into finer increments or decrements to mitigate vibration.
